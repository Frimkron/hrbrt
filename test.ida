[!] I should be testing behaviour regardless of implementation. 
- utility methods like ZeroOrMore are an implementation concern
[?] What is the desired behaviour of Document?
- Should invoke parsing of the other appropriate symbols.
- Should only consume input on success
[!] Correct working of the parse method is inherently linked to the 
	implementation of Input. But Input has its own tests - this would 
	result in test overlap.
[*] Mock out the Input class? 
- the implementation would have to recreate *all* of the behaviour of 
	Input for it to work properly. 
- It need only recreate the *necessary* behaviour. And while this may
	come close to the full implementation, it is free from the 
	implementation iteself in that the true implementation may become
	more sophisticated later on

So. We pass in a branchable, commitable mock input, and check that in 
addition to the appropriate symbols being invoked with the correct 
cardinality, the method leaves the mock input at the correct position.
